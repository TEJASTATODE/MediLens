build_backend:
  stage: build
  image: docker:24.0.5
  services:
    - docker:24.0.5-dind
  variables:

  script:
    # Log into GitLab's built-in Container Registry

    # Build the image using your Dockerfile inside the 'backend' folder
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/backend:latest ./backend
    # Push the image so it's stored on GitLab
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/backend:latest

# 2. DEPLOY STAGE: Tells Render there is a new image ready to pull

  image: curlimages/curl:latest
  script:
    # This triggers Render's "Deploy Hook" using the variable you saved
    - curl -X POST $RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK
  only:
    - main # This ensures it only deploys when you push to the main branch
